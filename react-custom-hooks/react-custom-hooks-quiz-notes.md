## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a React custom hook?
  user-defined functions that use one or more of the built-in React Hooks to encapsulate logic that can be reused across multiple components

- When are custom hooks useful? When are they not required?
  useful when you have logic that you want to share between multiple components.
  not useful when the logic you're dealing with is specific to a single component and does not need to be reused elsewhere.

- What is the syntax (or naming convention) for writing a custom hook?
  the keyword of "use"

- How do you call a custom hook?
  by importing the hook function and invoking it

- When do custom hooks execute?
  when they are called inside the functional components.

<!-- Custom Hook:
  Purpose: Custom hooks are ****functions that encapsulate reusable logic using React's built-in hooks****. They are used to abstract away complex logic into reusable functions, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
  ****Naming Convention: Custom hooks typically start with the word "use" to adhere to React's hook rules.
  Usage: Custom hooks can be used inside functional components to access and utilize the encapsulated logic. They are not meant to render any UI but rather provide hooks for managing state, side effects, or other functionalities.


Component Function:
  Purpose: Component functions, also known as functional components, are ****JavaScript functions that define the UI structure and behavior of a part of the application****.
  ****Naming Convention: Component functions can have any valid JavaScript function name and typically represent a specific part of the UI.
  Usage: Component functions are used to render UI elements and can include JSX code to describe what should be rendered on the screen. They may also utilize custom hooks or React's built-in hooks to manage state, handle user interactions, or fetch data. -->
